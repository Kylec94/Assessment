// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The second step Requirements Analysis will collect the functional and system requirements of the business process, the user requirements and the operational requirements (e.g., when operational what is necessary to keep the system up and running)."
const design = "The third step Design Phase is an essential phase of the Software Development Life Cycle. The list of requirements that you develop in the definition phase is used to make design choices. In the design phase, one or more designs are created to achieve the project result."
const implementation = "The fourth step Implementation includes user notification, user training, installation of hardware, installation of software onto production computers, and integration of the system into daily work processes. This phase continues until the system is operating in production in accordance with the defined user requirements."
const testingAndIntegration = "the fifth step Integration testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements."
const maintain = "And the final Maintenance phase of the SDLC occurs after the product is in full operation. Maintenance of software can include software upgrades, repairs, and fixes of the software if it breaks. Software applications often need to be upgraded or integrated with new systems the customer deploys."
