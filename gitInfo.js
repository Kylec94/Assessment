/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE

const gitDefinition = 'Git is a version control system and is a tool for developers to track and upload their code universally. Allows for coop coding and storage of small or large projects'

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE

const gitHubDefinition = 'Code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.'

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

//CODE HERE

const gitInitDefinition = 'puts code into a new repository'


//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.
*/

//CODE HERE

const gitCloneDefinition = 'targets existing repository and creates a clone'

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitStatusDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git status' does.
*/

//CODE HERE

const gitStatusDefinition ='Git status displays the state of the working directory'

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitAddDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

// Missed that this problem wanted 2 different things. 

const gitAddDefinition = 'The git add command adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.'

const gitAddCode = 'git add .' 

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to commit using the message "initial commit".
*/

// I read the variable for gitCommitDefinition and made it but then read the instructions for what to do for gitCommitCode... I was definitely feeling short on time at this point and in a hurry to move on. Also think reading the green text messes with me 

const gitCommitDefinition = 'The git commit command captures a snapshot of the projects currently staged changes'

const gitCommitCode = 'git commit -m "initial commit'


//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitPushDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git push' does.
*/

//CODE HERE

const gitPushDefinition = 'upload local repository content to a remote repository'
